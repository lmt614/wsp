			<h1>Project Analysis</h1>
			<h2>Site Intent</h2>
			<p>The main goal I hope to achieve in redesigning Christ Episcopal Church is to bring a focal point to the site, allowing the visitor to be drawn in or interested in the content. I will do this by organizing and condensing the content. I plan to remove unnecessary tables and give more visual hierarchy so that the content is more readable and information is easier to find. I would like to add a logo and create organized navigation. I would also like to implement a CTA (call to action) allowing the user the ability to interact with the interface. For instance, bringing in a newsletter, where they can fill out a form and sign up for updates or events. I would like for this site to have a liquid layout by using responsive type units such as ems and percentages and shifting the content. This will make the website more functional on a wider variety of screen sizes and resolutions. Bringing the site up to standards with HTML5 and CSS3 will give us a faster more efficient site.
